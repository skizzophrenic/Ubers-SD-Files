==Doorbell from ornotermes==

PCB is labeled W727, uses 433.92MHz and 25 bits of data.
Includes a spreadsheet to generate similar codes with different patterns.

The transmitter has a button in the back to change between 8 transmitted codes and the receiver plays a different sound depending on what code is sent. Found there was space for more codes so tried what looked like the rest of the codes. Found an alarm sound that the transmitter can't activate.

These are (likely) not my captures but they have worked for others. Try with your doorbell!
