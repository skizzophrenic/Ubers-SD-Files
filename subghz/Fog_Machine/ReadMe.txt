==Fog Machine Remote Controller==

FCC ID: ZIFIL-1

There was an original upload to @UberGuidoZ repo by @the0bone for a Theefun TFM01 fog machine. Thanks!

I've found that this company makes most fog machines internal componants and sells to many manufacturers.
Global Special Effects, Fog Masters, Chauvet, American DJ, Eliminator, Magmatic, are all the same remote.
This receiver uses a standard C-13/C-14 connector like a PC power cord.

I haven't found a fog machine with any other rf remote than this one. So have fun.
