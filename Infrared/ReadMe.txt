Keeping all the IR files in my fork of the Flipper-IRDB! (I'm now able to maintain the entire branch.)

Did you know you can quickly generate your own IR files on the go at https://flippermaker.github.io/

You may have manifest file issues if you do not compile your own firmware, or use one of the listed firmwares above!
